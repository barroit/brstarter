This framework works with GCC (>= 9) and Clang (>= 6), as well as BFD and
LLD. There are no plans to support other compilers or linkers, such as MSVC,
in the future.

To set up a project using this framework, the following programs are required:

	Perl	(>= 5.8)
	jq	(>= 1.0)
	Bash	(>= 4.3)
	Git

First, prepare a .program.in file. Copying .program.in.example might be a good
starting point. Once you've filled in the required information, run:

	make scripts/init.sh

This command will generate the necessary files for building the project. After
setup, you will have a commit titled 'INITIAL CONSUMER'. That commit contains
the changes made by init.sh. You can then start committing your own changes.

The following programs are used to build this project:

	Python3	(>= 3.6)
	CMake	(>= 21)
	Kconfiglib
	GNU Make or PowerShell

You can run one of the following commands, depending on what you need:

	make menuconfig
		run Kconfig

	make all
		configure and build the project

	make configure
		configure the project

	make build
		build the project (default target)

	make
		build the project

If there is no .config file (generated by Kconfig), 'make configure' will use
the default arguments to configure the build.

NB: Before running 'make build', you must configure the build. I don't mix
configuration and building into a single target because the overhead is huge
and often causes freezes. However, for a build after Kconfig changes (not
including the initial configuration), you can simply run 'make build', as
CMake will handle the configuration automatically.
