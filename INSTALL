This framework works with GCC (>= 9) and Clang (>= 6), as well as BFD and LLD.
There's no plan to support other compilers or linkers, like MSVC, in the future.

The following programs are required:

	CMake	(>= 21)
	Perl	(>= 5.8)
	jq	(>= 1.0)
	Bash	(>= 4.3)
	Git

To set up the project, first prepare a .program.in. Copying .program.in.example
might be a good starting point. Once you've filled in the required information,
run 'make scripts/init.sh', this will generate necessary files.

After setup, you will have a commit titled 'INITIAL CONSUMER'. That commit
contains the changes made by init.sh.
