Meaning of NG39
---------------
NG39 stands for ネギミク, where ネギ (negi) is NG and ミク (miku) is 39 ;)

GNU Make behaviors
------------------
When running make, the default target is not a complete "one-stop" build but
only handles the build operation. Configuration is not included, as it involves
calling kconfiglib commands, which can be problematic. This can cause the
configuration to get stuck for a few moments due to some additional overhead of
Kconfig functions.

No redundant quotes in Kconfig symbol values
--------------------------------------------
For some symbols like PROG_NAME and CC_NAME, there are no quotes around the
value retrieved by $(). This is intentional, as these symbols must have a
non-empty value. Quoting them may cause unexpected behavior if, let's say,
there's a bug. By not quoting them, the behavior is correct even if a bug
occurs, since a non-empty value will make kconfiglib panic.

No wchar on Unix-like platforms
-------------------------------
We use multi-byte characters instead of wide characters on these systems.
So there's no need (and should not) to care about the wchar type on these
platforms.
