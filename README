Brukit is a utility designed for quickly starting a TUI project. It is tailored
for C/C++ development and includes commonly used APIs, such as strbuf and
strlist. Most importantly, it provides Unicode text handling and is compatible
with Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and Windows.

Brukit is dual-licensed under GPLv3 and MIT. You can choose either of these
licenses or any license compatible with them and apply it to your project.
