                                     TAGS

Avoid introducing new tags whenever possible, as this makes tracking changes to
a specific part harder. Each tag can be prefixed with an optional platform. The
currently available platforms are:

	unix	(POSIX-friendly)
	win32	(API-messy)
	darwin
	freebsd
	linux

Some other tags may also serve as prefixes, such as:

	tests	- indicates test updates for that part
	docs	- indicates documentation updates for that part

The list of tags:

<name>:
	changes related to a specific feature (path, strlist, or fiter)

cmd/<name>:
	changes related to commands

scripts/<name>:
	changes under scripts/

vscode:
	changes under .vscode/

i18n:
	changes under locale/

git:
	.codespellrc
	.gitignore
	.hooks/

build:
	make.ps1
	Makefile

cmake:
	changes related to CMake

kconfig:
	changes related to Kconfig

There are also some escape hatch tags. These tags should not be used in a
normal commit, but they are not prohibited:

style:
	only use this tag when style changes affect multiple files

license:
	only use this tag when license amendments affect multiple files

cleanup:
	only use this tag when removing a file or a bunch of code from multiple
	files

NB: There are some files at the top level of the project with names in all
uppercase. For commits to these files, the tag should be the name of the file.
